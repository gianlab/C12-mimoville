### Branching Strategy

Master
Develop
Feature
Hotfix

<aside> ðŸš¨ Branches are primarily used as a means for teams to develop features giving them a separate workspace for their code. These branches are usually merged back to a master branch upon completion of work. In this way, features (and any bug and bug fixes) are kept apart from each other allowing you to fix mistakes more easily.
